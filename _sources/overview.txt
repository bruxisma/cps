Overview
========

A CPS file provides a declarative description of a package that is intended to be consumed by other packages that build against that package. By providing a detailed, flexible, and language-agnostic description using widely supported JSON grammar, CPS aims to make it easy to portably consume packages, regardless of build systems used.

Like pkg-config files and CMake package configuration files, CPS files are intended to be produced by the package provider, and included in the package's distribution. Additionally, the CPS file is not intended to cover all *possible* configurations of a package; rather, it is meant to be generated by the build system and to describe the artifacts of one or more *extant* configurations for a single architecture.

One important note is that, while CPS includes support for executable targets (typically used for making available code generation tools), CPS does *not* try to provide a portable mechanism for specifying how such a tool should be invoked. This is not a problem that lends itself to simple, generic solutions. It is left to the consumer to know how to do this, and/or to the package to provide additional, tool-specific utilities for this purpose.

Development Process
===================

The specification is curated by the editor in chief
(currently Matthew Woehlke)
and is maintained in a `github repository`_.

Community Involvement
'''''''''''''''''''''

Development of the specification
is intended to be an open process.
Contributions are welcome from anyone.
Problems or feature requests
should be filed against the github project.

We do not have a mailing list at this time,
although we expect to start one
once there is significant community involvement.
For now, please direct comments to `the editor`_.
